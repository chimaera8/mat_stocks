# MAT_STOCKS

This repository is a collection of scientific code written within the [MAT_STOCKS](boku.ac.at/understanding-the-role-of-material-stock-patterns-for-the-transformation-to-a-sustainable-society-mat-stocks) project.

Much of this code here is application-specific, quick-and-dirty, pragmatic scientific code, and not meant to be used as standalone, sophisticated software solution.
